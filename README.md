# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
Deployment Using ngrok
Follow the steps below to deploy the application using ngrok:

Set Up ngrok
Go to https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/setup.

Download ngrok
Download a standalone executable with zero runtime dependencies based on your architecture:

Download for macOS — Apple Silicon
Download for macOS — Intel
Install ngrok
In a terminal, extract the ngrok executable by running:

bash
Copy code
sudo unzip ~/Downloads/ngrok-v3-stable-darwin-arm64.zip -d /usr/local/bin
Add Authtoken
Run the following command to add your authtoken to the default ngrok.yml configuration file:

bash
Copy code
ngrok config add-authtoken 2q0kU0B7n7MMeiWXAtrvSDIfCRE_J8XBjFsNvdcPnotTuBS5
Start the React Application
Ensure your React application is running locally. Use the following command:

bash
Copy code
npm start
By default, React runs on http://localhost:3000.

Expose Your Application
In a terminal, run ngrok to expose your local app to the web:

bash
Copy code
ngrok http http://localhost:3000
ngrok will generate a public URL, such as:
https://3cab-72-84-69-192.ngrok-free.app/

Access the Application
Use the generated public URL to access your application from anywhere via HTTPS.
